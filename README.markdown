This Raspberry Pi add-on daughterboard or shield incorporates a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD display (standard HD44780-type display), a visible light sensor, a barometric pressure
and temperature sensor, a smal RGB LED for visual output, and an Atmel ATmega128RFA1 AVR microcontroller with integrated IEEE 802.15.4 mesh network transceiver with support
for IPv6/6LoWPAN. 

A real-time clock with battery backup and a buck-converter voltage regulator allowing a wide input voltage range between 7 and 35 volts to power the Raspberry Pi are also
included. Voltages up to 35V can simply be plugged into the 2.1mm power jack to power the entire system flexibly.
